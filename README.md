About The host provider:
GitHub Pages is a free service that allows you to host a static website on GitHub. A static website is one that is composed entirely of static files like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This indicates that the website does not require dynamic server generation, making it extremely quick and simple to host.
To host a website on GitHub Pages, you must first establish a public repository called username.github.io, where username corresponds to your GitHub username. In such case, you can include the files for your website in this repository. When you push updates to the repository, GitHub Pages will immediately create and launch your website.
An excellent choice for hosting a straightforward website, such as a portfolio or blog, is GitHub Pages. It is a wonderful choice for hosting a website that doesn't require frequent updates.

Explanations of the technologies and tools used in building the website:
HTML: HyperText Markup Language is the foundation of all web pages. It is used to specify a web page's organization and content, including the headers, paragraphs, graphics, and lists. It serves as the industry standard markup language for online pages. Using tags, HTML describes the structure of a web page. Tags are instructions that a web browser uses to determine how to display a web page's content.


CSS: The style sheet language known as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to describe how a document produced in a markup language like HTML or XML is presented. Web developers may construct documents whose display is independent of the underlying markup thanks to CSS, which was created to facilitate the separation of presentation and content.
A web page's look may be modified with CSS in a number of ways, including:
	The colour, font, and size of text
	The layout of elements on the page
	The background colour and images
	The borders and margins of elements
	The effects applied to elements, such as shadows and gradients

JavaScript: A web page may be made interactive by using JavaScript, a computer language, to include animations, pop-up windows, and forms. Because it is a client-side scripting language, the user's web browser runs the code. As a result, JavaScript is incredibly flexible and may be used for a variety of tasks, including:
•	Change the appearance of a web page
•	Add animations and interactivity
•	Validate user input
•	Create games and other interactive applications
Visual Studio Code: Visual Studio Code is a powerful code editor that can be used to write HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other programming languages. It has a number of features that make it ideal for web development, such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and debugging.
